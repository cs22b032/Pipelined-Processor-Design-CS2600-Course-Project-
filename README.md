The only cpp file named "main.cpp" contain the whole code.
No need to pass argument in terminal while executing.
It will automatically read input file from input folder , it should be named as 'ICache.txt', 'DCache.txt', and 'RF.txt'.
output file will be generated in output file named as 'DCache.txt' and 'Output.txt'.








Overview of Project.

– Utilized object-oriented programming in C++ to develop a simulator for a five-stage scalar pipelined RISC
processor, enhancing execution speed with parallel stage execution and advanced cache design.
– Implemented and tested sophisticated hazard detection mechanisms, measuring performance by counting
instructions and hazards to ensure accurate pipeline functionalit
